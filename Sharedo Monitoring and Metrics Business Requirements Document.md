ðŸ“Œ **2. Detailed Monitoring Requirements**

### 2.1 Event Engine Requirements

* Real-time metrics on event processing performance, including throughput, latency, and resource utilization
* Monitoring and reporting on event queues, backlog durations, dead letter management, and workflow error rates
* Alerts for system stability and role instance status, including proactive notification for instance downtime and resource spikes
* Implementation of fail-safe mechanisms for recursive and long-running workflows, including administrative intervention workflows

### 2.2 API Monitoring Requirements

* Endpoint performance tracking with response times and error rate monitoring
* Security metrics, including authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts, and session management
* Early detection and notification of API degradation or outages

### 2.3 Database Monitoring Requirements

* Continuous monitoring of transaction performance, query execution efficiency, and database connection health
* Real-time metrics for transaction failures and database performance bottlenecks
* Data integrity monitoring with proactive alerts for inconsistencies or unusual transaction patterns

### 2.4 Integration Health Monitoring

* Ongoing monitoring of external integrations (e.g., Aderant, iManage) with metrics on synchronization delays and response times
* Alerts for integration failures, token expiration issues, and service disruptions
* Automated checks for link service connections and refresh tokens to ensure continuous availability

### 2.5 Business Process and Operational Metrics

* Document generation success rates, processing efficiency, and template performance
* Workflow lifecycle monitoring, including detection of stalled or indefinitely running workflows
* Tracking of user notification delivery success across email, SMS, and app notifications

### 2.6 Enhanced Reporting and Diagnostics

* Automated collection and reporting from execution engine logs to identify trends and spikes in errors and backlogs
* Comprehensive dashboard visibility of system health, event metrics, and operational status indicators
* Historical trend analysis capabilities for proactive system management and issue resolution
