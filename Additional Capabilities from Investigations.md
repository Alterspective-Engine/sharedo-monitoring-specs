# Monitoring Health & Alerting — Business Value Summary

Scope: A business-focused view of how our health and monitoring capability protects outcomes, reduces risk, and accelerates delivery across AI, workflow automation, and platform services. This avoids implementation detail and centers on value, analytics, and decision support.

## Business Outcomes Enabled
- Uptime and reliability guarantees
  - Early detection of degradation prevents outages and SLA breaches.
  - Shorter Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Restore (MTTR).
- Customer and operational efficiency
  - Visibility of workflow backlogs and error hotspots reduces rework and delays.
  - Prioritized remediation based on business impact, not noise.
- Risk and compliance assurance
  - Evidence packs for incidents, release gates, and audits.
  - Consistent health baselines across environments.
- Delivery velocity and confidence
  - Release impact surfaced within minutes (before/after, canary vs control).
  - Fewer rollbacks through objective readiness signals.

## Analytics Lenses (What We Measure)
- Platform health
  - Throughput, backlog, and processing lag across event streams and services.
  - Dependency availability and saturation trends (search, identity, indexers).
  - Connection health and capacity signals to prevent brownouts.
- Workflow and execution reliability
  - Volume by type and state (Running, Waiting, Stopped, Errored).
  - Aging and stuck indicators, dead-letter growth, and top error reasons.
  - Time-in-step and end-to-end duration distribution (p50/p95) to find bottlenecks.
- AI system health (where applicable)
  - Latency and cost per request, retry/timeout rates, safety/guardrail triggers.
  - Output quality proxies: resolution rate, human-overrides, dissatisfaction flags.
  - Drift signals across data/prompt/model versions; change in success patterns.
- Business impact mapping
  - Backlog and failure rates translated into SLA/OLAs and customer impact.
  - Work type and customer segment heatmaps for targeted interventions.

## Environment Comparison (Parity & Drift)
- Side-by-side health baselines for Dev/Test/UAT/Prod to catch drift early.
- Trend and percentile comparisons between environments and time windows.
- Release-candidate vs Production: highlight regressions before global rollout.

## Deployment & Change Impact Analysis
- Before/after and canary/control comparisons on key health and reliability KPIs.
- Change-correlation views: which release or config change aligns with a spike in errors, lag, or costs.
- Guardrail thresholds that block promotion when health or quality regresses.

## Alerting Strategy (Signal, Not Noise)
- Business-aligned SLOs and burn-rate alerts that reflect real risk to customers.
- Composite alerts that combine platform lag, workflow errors, and AI quality drops to avoid paging on single transient metrics.
- Priority tiers (P1–P3) with clear ownership and routing to reduce time-to-action.

## Scorecards & Dashboards
- Operations Health Score: availability, lag, backlog, and error rate rollups.
- Workflow Reliability Score: success ratio, MTTR, aging, and dead-letter trend.
- AI Quality & Cost Score: success/override rate, safety events, latency, unit cost.
- Release Readiness: pre/post metrics deltas, regression flags, and go/no-go.
- Environment Drift: config and performance variance across stages.

## Stakeholder Value at a Glance
- Executives: outage risk, SLA posture, incident trends, release confidence.
- Product/Operations: customer impact, queue health, throughput vs demand.
- Engineering: bottleneck hotspots, regression sources, prioritized fixes.
- Data/AI: model quality trends, drift indicators, safety guardrail efficacy.

## KPIs We Track (Illustrative)
- Reliability: Availability, MTTR, MTTD, Error/Dead-letter rates, Stuck age p95.
- Flow: Throughput, Backlog, Processing lag, End-to-end duration p50/p95.
- AI: Success/override rate, Safety events, Latency p95, Unit cost per request.
- Change: Pre/post delta on key KPIs; regression count; time-to-stable after deploy.

## Governance & Evidence
- Time-stamped health snapshots, incident timelines, and remediation outcomes.
- Release impact records tied to health deltas for audit and continuous improvement.

This capability gives an actionable, business-first picture of system health across AI, workflows, and core services—enabling faster, safer change with measurable customer impact.
